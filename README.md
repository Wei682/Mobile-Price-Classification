# Mobile Price Classification
This is part of my final project for my machine learning course.
This project applies different machine learning algorithms and techniques to analyze and do mobile phone price classification. The dataset is from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification.

## Preprocess and feature selection
### Feature Scaling
sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler()

### Feature selection
Chi-Square

## Supervised Analysis
### Logistic Regression
  1. Complete models with different settings (1. without feature transformation, with squared transformation, with cubic transformation 2. C = 0.1 , 1, or 100000000 3.L1 or L2 penalty) 18 combinations in total.
  2. Plot and compare the accuracies of the 18 models. 
  3. Use the model with highest validation accuracy to predict the test data. 

### Neural Network
  1. Complete models with different settings (1. without feature transformation, with squared transformation, with cubic transformation 2. 3-layer, 4-layer 3.no penalty, L1 penalty, or L2 penalty) 18 combinations in total.
  2. Plot and compare the accuracies of the 18 models. 
  3. Use the model with highest validation accuracy to predict the test data.
